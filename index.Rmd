Can Data Science solve all of the worlds problems? Of course not (Even Superman couldn't solve all of the worlds problems!) But the scope and application of data science is very wide, it ranges from making our daily shopping more efficient to building smart cities and predicting natural disasters. It has equipped organizations and governments with data driven insights to tackle a lot of issues efficiently and build sustainable solutions. I am excited to add a few ideas of my own to this list.

### Abstract of my first cool idea

The core concept of my first idea is to achieve product excellence through a customer-driven approach. In this case the product is a Satellite TV package tailored to a customer's needs. The idea is to build a data-driven solution that would package TV channels based on a customer's viewing patterns. Some of the major challenges are the technicalities of analyzing TV viewing patterns, impact to the company's profitability etc. Navigating through these challenges smoothly and improving customer retention by enabling customer care representatives with relevant data is the main focus of the project. For more details, Please read on.

### Abstract of my second cool idea

Pocket Botanist, as the name suggests, aims to provide farmers easy access to the research and knowledge of botanists. The primary focus of the idea is to be the first level of reference for farmers to adopt Mixed Farming based on geographic and crop specific parameters. In the long term, the goal is to enable farmers to follow profitable, but sustainable agricultural practices with data driven inputs. The sheer volume and variety of data that needs to be processed is one of the major challenges of this project, but these challenges are worth grappling with in order to build a sustainable future.
