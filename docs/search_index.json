Of course not (Even Superman couldn’t solve all of the worlds problems!) But the scope and application of data science is very wide, it ranges from making our daily shopping more efficient to building smart cities and predicting natural disasters. It has equipped organizations and governments with data driven insights to tackle a lot of issues efficiently and build sustainable solutions. I am excited to add a few ideas of my own to this list. Figure 2: Hello Benjamin Franklin! Pocket Botanist Pocket Botanist, as the name suggests, aims to provide farmers easy access to the research and knowledge of botanists. The primary focus of the idea is to be the first level of reference for farmers to adopt Mixed Farming based on geographic and crop specific parameters. In the long term, the goal is to enable farmers to follow profitable, but sustainable agricultural practices with data driven inputs. The sheer volume and variety of data that needs to be processed is one of the major challenges of this project, but these challenges are worth grappling with in order to build a sustainable future. Please read on to know more.. Smart Package Builder The core concept of my first idea is to achieve product excellence through a customer-driven approach. In this case the product is a Satellite TV package tailored to a customer’s needs. The idea is to build a data-driven solution that would package TV channels based on a customer’s viewing patterns. Some of the major challenges are the technicalities of analyzing TV viewing patterns, impact to the company’s profitability etc. Navigating through these challenges smoothly and improving customer retention by enabling customer care representatives with relevant data is the main focus of the project.

["mind-the-customer.html", "Smart Package Builder Current State (Generic retention packages). Data-driven Solution. Future State (Customized packages).", " Smart Package Builder Keywords Downgrade packages, Cancel Subscription, customize packages, Viewing patterns, Similar packages Current State (Generic retention packages). I work for satellite service provider organization. Around 5 to 7 % of customers call our customer support monthly either to downgrade their packages or cancel their monthly subscription due to high monthly bill. Currently our organization offers standard retention packages to those customers who call to cancel the service. For customers calling to downgrade packages, the focus is only on reducing the number of channels in the package to bring the price down. These packages are generic as there is no intelligent packaging of channels. So, the new packages may or may not be appealing to the customer. With this solution, we want to enable our customer service representatives to offer customized retention packages instead. Data-driven Solution. Our solution needs details of customer's current package, viewing patterns of the customer and channel catalog data from Offers Management System. This data is used by the solution to compute the list of &quot;N&quot; most watched channels by the customer. This data will be presented to the customer service representative in a chart with a filter to control &quot;N&quot; (for e.g.: Top 5 Channels, Top 10 Channels etc.). Fig 1: High level Solution Architecture Based on this data the customer service representative can offer to create a package with &quot;N&quot; most watched channels, &quot;N&quot; being the customer's choice. The algorithm also acts as a recommendation engine by suggesting other channels which show content similar to the &quot;N&quot; channels selected by the customers. These suggestions will be presented as a list when the filter to control &quot;N&quot; in the chart is toggled by the rep. The organization must also ensure the profitability factor while offering these packages. Therefore collaboration with business analysts and various stake holders who currently own the task of building packages is very important. The algorithm will have business rules to analyse profitability of a package, if the profit margin drops below a certain level that package will be flaged as ‘infeasible’ and it will be filtered out from the recommendations. Future State (Customized packages). We are enabling our customer support teams to serve customers better using this data driven solution. Offering generalized retention packages to the customer will seem mechanical, whereas offering to build a customized package for the customer will help the representative to establish a better connect with the customer. Thus, the odds of retaining the customer will increase. The limitations of the solution The solution is just an enabler, the actual impact on customer retention is also dependent on the skills of customer care representatives to market these customized packages. This limitation can be overcome by training the Customer care representatives to use the solution in their interactions with the customer. For a relatively new customer, the available viewing pattern data may not be enough to compute the most watched &quot;N&quot; channels accurately. Nevertheless, this solution makes the customer retention strategy data driven and smart. "],

Impact On Soil Quality.", " Pocket Botanist Keywords Soil Quality, Soil Erosion, Soil Composition, Water Erosion, Wind Erosion, Primary Crops , Secondary Crops, Bio Wastes, Agriculture, Crop Rotation Farming and Soil Quality. Evolving agricultural practices have contributed immensely to the progress of civilization. Modern farming techniques have helped farmers to improve yields, keep pests at bay and optimize resource utilization. While this has helped us to ensure availability of food for the growing population in most parts of the world, it has also resulted in the degradation of soil quality which is leading to soil erosion. There are numerous researches conducted in this field to find the right balance between improving crop yields and maintaining soil quality. These researches point to adopting certain proven farming techniques to reduce the pace of soil degradation and to aid the process of regeneration of nutrients in soil. Mixed cropping is one such technique and this solution will focus on this technique. A Pocket Guide For Farmers. The intention is to provide a pocket guide in the form of web/mobile app to the farmers that they can use as their first level reference for mixed cropping based on the selected geography and crop specific parameters. The solution will also suggest organic wastes that the farmer can use as manure to aid the crops that will be grown in their land. Fig 1: High level Solution Architecture The solution will be split into three parts, the first is to provide a crop yield trend over the past 5 or 10 years to the farmer using the data from data.gov. This would help new farmers who may have leased a piece of land to understand how the soil has been used historically. The second part of the solution is to suggest primary and secondary crops that can be grown in the land based on the soil type, mineral composition and soil PH. This step requires two sets of data i.e. geography wise soil composition and a Master crop database that records requisites to grow any specific crop. Soil composition of the geography selected by the user will be matched with the requisites in the master crop database and the suggestion engine will provide a list of suitable primary crops and associated secondary crops. Combining a secondary crop with a primary is called Mixed cropping and it’s one of the most acknowledged method of cultivation to improve soil quality and to check water and wind erosion. Suggestion of secondary crops will consider compatibility with the primary crop so that they do not compete for nutrients and water. Web Soil Survey initiative by the United States Department of Agriculture collects data about soil conditions throughout the US and the proposal is to use this data. But the master crop database needs to be built in collaboration with botanists and researchers. Using the master crop database, the solution would also help to identify bio wastes that could be used as manure to enrich the soil with essential nutrients for the suggested crops. Impact On Soil Quality. This solution provides farmers access to data driven research in the form of simple dashboards. The fact that the yield of the Secondary crop is an additional contributor to the farmer’s income makes it financially attractive. From a soil conservation perspective, since more percentage of crop land is now covered with vegetation it directly counteracts soil erosion caused due to run-away water and heavy wind. The usage of bio waste will also aid the regeneration of nutrients in the soil without the harmful side-effects of using chemical manures. The crop residue from secondary crops could also be ploughed into the land as another source of natural manure. Limitations Building the master crop database with specific parameters for all crops grown in a country is time and effort intensive. As the first step this database could be compiled for a small region to develop a prototype and pitch the solution for wider implementation. Other factors such as climatic conditions and availability of irrigation in a geographic region also play a major role in growth of crops. Though in its current form the solution doesn’t consider these points, they could be explored in the future.
